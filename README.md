# Infinite-Resignation Infinite Resignation will be a two-dimensional strategy game with a top-down view. On an aesthetic and story level, Infinite Resignation will have a medieval, high fantasy theme: complete with humans, elves, dwarves, monsters, and the like. Gameplay will involve assigning the player’s avatar — as well as ally characters — specific tasks to execute on a battlefield in order to accomplish overarching level objectives — survive for x number of rounds, protect non-player character y, secure point z etc. Unlike Fire Emblem, characters will not execute their tasks immediately. Rather the player will assign tasks to be executed all at once, with friendly characters and enemies acting concurrently.

The Game will be created using the Lazerus Game Engine link below
